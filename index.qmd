OneGeochemistry is an international collaboration between multiple national and international organisations that support geochemistry capability and data production. Our focus is to better coordinate global efforts in geochemical data standardisation, facilitate communication between groups and lessen duplication of efforts.

It is our mission to advance geoscientific knowledge and discoveries by building and maintaining consensus-driven standards that make geochemistry research data globally findable and accessible, and truly interoperable and reusable to both humans and machines.
OneGeochemistry seeks to create a global geochemical data network that facilitates and promotes data discovery and access through coordination and collaboration among international geochemical data providers.
