description-title: building and maintaining consensus-driven data standards for geochemistry
---

OneGeochemistry is a global initiative that brings together major geochemical data providers and the geochemical research community with the objective of establishing global standards and best practices for FAIR geochemical laboratory analytical data that are as open as possible and as closed as necessary.
OneGeochemistry operates as a [CODATA Working Group](https://codata.org/initiatives/making-data-work/worldfair-2/onegeochemistry-wg/).

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Vision
OneGeochemistry is working towards an interoperable global geochemical data network that links international geochemical data service providers.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Mission
Advance scientific knowledge and discovery by promoting best practices and protocols for reporting geochemical data that will make the data not only globally findable and accessible, but also interoperable and reusable (FAIR).

## Endorsed by
The following international geo- and cosmochemical societies have endorsed OneGeochemistry as the trusted international initiative tasked with bringing together the community and coordinate global efforts in geochemical data standardisation.
<!--Their endorsement will help disseminate the goals and activities of OneGeochemistry to a broad membership throughout the geochemical sub-disciplines, and increase participation in the initiative. Additional national and/or sub-disciplinary societies will be contacted in the future and the OneGeochemistry board invites suggestions and recommendations from the community.-->

## Supported by
Predominantly a voluntary effort, the OneGeochemistry initiative is currently run through a working group of the International Science Council’s Committee on DATA (CODATA) and receives a small amount of funding through the Horizon Europe project 'WorldFAIR' and from AuScope. Most OneGeochemistry activities are directly supported by the participating national and international data systems.
