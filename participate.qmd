OneGeochemistry is an initiative for the community by the community. OneGeochemistry aims to become an organisation that coordinates across all geo- and cosmochemical data types, both supporting existing community standards as well as facilitating the development of new ones where needed.

The OneGeochemistry initiative is a voluntary effort supported by a part time funded coordinator and only works with through the involvement of the community, your involvement.

## Ways to get involved

<!-- Putting in a link use [] for the text the link applies to and then () for the actual link -->

Involvement has many forms. We are always keen to hear your ideas, comments and feedback on the initiative. If you have more time to contribute, consider becoming an ambassador, joining or starting an expert committee to help with the development of digital best practices. Just want to keep informed? Then join the Slack channel and/or email list.

OneGeochemistry is still developing and we want your input in designing the future of the initiative! We are planning a community workshop in mid 2024 where you can shape the future of OneGeochemistry, vote for the next governance board and perhaps even put yourself up for election. More details to follow.


### Slack Channel or Email

[Join our slack channel](https://onegeochemistry.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-18gjyj49u-FRf1XwCU1vj8xxCEUYoD7Q#/shared-invite/email) for ad-hoc updates and requests from the organisation, it is an open platform where you can share ideas and suggestions. This is the place for low latency messaging and rapid sharing of resources.

### Meet us at the next Conference

OneGeochemistry is represented at most of the major, international geoscience and geochemistry conferences. Find out more about the initiative and meet the current members: it is easy to get in touch with any of us there, please come over for a chat about the initiative. See the [conference calendar](participate.qmd#conference-calendar) below for upcoming events near you.

### Contact the Coordinator

Send your questions, comments and ideas to the current OneGeochemistry secretary Alexander Prent at [onegeochemistry\@codata.org](mailto:onegeochemistry@codata.org).

<!-- **We'll share some info on such and such basis, these are the channels, actively ask people to share the initiative's imperative** -->


### Become a OneGeochemistry Ambassador
Ambassadors are envisaged as early to mid-career researchers that promote good data management following current best practices and standards. Assisted by the OneGeochemistry board members, ambassadors will spread awareness in the communities of the importance of data management in geo- and cosmochemistry, the existing landscape of data systems, and inspire new and future generations to contribute.

Get in touch at [onegeochemistry\@codata.org](mailto:onegeochemistry@codata.org) if you are interested or want to find out more.

### Expert Committees


**Scientific expert committees:**
A group of geochemical research experts on a specific geochemical data type and or methodology are asked to review the technical implementation steps or solutions devised by the “Technical Expert Committee” whom based these on the existing literature (preferably peer reviewed published best practices)

**Technical expert committee:**
A group of information technology experts specifying in implementation of information management strategies will build and publish vocabularies on RVA or other including metadata profiles that make datasets FAIR and help to implement the means to support this into repositories or data management workflows.


<!-- ### Become a Member

Becoming a member is the lightweight option with which you will receive updates via a mailing list and are actively encouraged to share your ideas about the best way to make geochemical data and resources more interoperable across the globe.

Being a member you can make yourself electable for the board, join or lead scientific and technical expert committees to advise on and help coordinate development of standard data reporting methods, method specific vocabularies, as well as metadata profiles. -->

<!-- ### Become a Partner

Data infrastructure organisations, or groups as well as laboratories and institutes can become OneGeochemistry partner and contribute via a representative member of their organisation to the OneGeochemistry mission.

Making geochemical data more standardised and interoperable between institutions and nations **creating a global network of geochemical data resources**. -->
