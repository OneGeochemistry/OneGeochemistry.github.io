OneGeochemistry is an initiative for the community by the community. The OneGeochemistry initiative is a voluntary effort supported by a part time funded coordinator and relies on the involvement of the community: your involvement.

OneGeochemistry aims to become an organisation that coordinates across all geo- and cosmochemical data types, both supporting existing community standards as well as facilitating the development of new ones where needed.

## Ways to get involved

::: {.column width="82%"}
Involvement has many forms. We are always keen to hear your ideas, comments and feedback on the initiative. If you have more time to contribute, consider becoming an [ambassador](participate.qmd#become-a-onegeochemistry-ambassador), joining or starting an [expert committee](participate.qmd#expert-committees) to help with the development of digital best practices. Just want to keep informed? Then [join the Slack channel](participate.qmd#newsletter) and/or email list.

OneGeochemistry is still developing and we want your input in designing the future of the initiative! We are planning a community workshop in mid 2024 where you can shape the future of OneGeochemistry, vote for the next governance board and perhaps even put yourself up for election. More details to follow.

Ambassadors are envisaged as early to mid-career researchers that promote good data management following current best practices and standards. Assisted by the OneGeochemistry board members, ambassadors will spread awareness in the communities of the importance of data management in geo- and cosmochemistry, the existing landscape of data systems, and inspire new and future generations to contribute.

Get in touch at [onegeochemistry\@codata.org](mailto:onegeochemistry@codata.org) if you are interested or want to find out more.

### Expert Committees
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="15%"}
![](images/expert-committee.jpg)
:::
::: {.column width="3%"}
:::
::: {.column width="82%"}
Multiple best practices and recommendations for specific data types, analytical techniques or sub-disciplines have already been defined (see [Best Practices](best_practices.qmd)). The larger the size of the community that agrees and commits to a particular standard, the larger the community that can share and reuse data, particularly in machine-to-machine environments. OneGeochemistry provides the framework and support to harmonise and curate these existing standards through expert committees.

The task of these expert committees would be to compile and further develop standards for each distinct analytical technique or related groups of analytical methods. We suggest two types of committees:

**Scientific expert committees:**
A group of geochemistry experts who review, harmonise and aggregate existing best practices for a specific geochemical data type and/or methodology (e.g. metadata profiles, vocabularies).

**Technical expert committee:**
A group of information technology experts who implement the recommended best practices in machine-readable format.

<!--**Test Of Elements paper last Paragraph**
The OneGeochemistry initiative invites you, other researchers, data groups and initiatives to help make the introductory vision come true, by making geochemical data more standardised and interoperable between institutions and nations creating a global network of geochemical data resources. For more information please visit the OneGeochemistry website on www.onegeochemistry.org. Please join OneGeochemistry using the above mentioned channels or by getting in touch with Alexander Prent on onegeochemistry@codata.org. -->

<!-- ### Become a Member

Becoming a member is the lightweight option with which you will receive updates via a mailing list and are actively encouraged to share your ideas about the best way to make geochemical data and resources more interoperable across the globe.

Being a member you can make yourself electable for the board, join or lead scientific and technical expert committees to advise on and help coordinate development of standard data reporting methods, method specific vocabularies, as well as metadata profiles. -->

<!-- ### Become a Partner

Data infrastructure organisations, or groups as well as laboratories and institutes can become OneGeochemistry partner and contribute via a representative member of their organisation to the OneGeochemistry mission.

Making geochemical data more standardised and interoperable between institutions and nations **creating a global network of geochemical data resources**. -->
