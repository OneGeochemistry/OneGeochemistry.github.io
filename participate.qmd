OneGeochemistry is an initiative for the community by the community. The OneGeochemistry initiative is a voluntary effort and relies on the involvement of the community: your involvement.

OneGeochemistry aims to become an organisation that coordinates across all geo- and cosmochemical data types, both supporting existing community standards as well as facilitating the development of new ones where needed.
:::
::::






## Ways to get involved
Involvement has many forms. We are always keen to hear your ideas, comments and feedback on the initiative. If you have more time to contribute, consider becoming an ambassador, joining or starting an expert committee to help with the development of digital best practices. Just want to keep informed? Then join the email list and/or Slack channel.

For general enquiries, comments and suggestions contact [onegeochemistry\@codata.org](mailto:onegeochemistry@codata.org).






### Membership

As a member you will receive regular updates on OneGeochemistry activities and other relevant information via our community email list.
Members can also join or lead expert committees to develop or maintain standards for geochemical data reporting (see [below](participate.qmd#expert-committees)).

Members are expected to align with and support the goals, interests, and principles of the OneGeochemistry initiative.

## Join OneGeochemistry today!
General membership may be obtained through self-nomination by registering for the [OneGeochemistry community email list](https://lists.codata.org/mailman/listinfo/onegeochemistry-community_lists.codata.org).
:::

Data systems that are interested in collaboration through OneGeochemistry are encouraged to apply for *Type 2* membership by contacting onegeochemistry\@codata.org. Type 2 membership is open to all repository and database providers, research and government infrastructures that develop and/or operate substantial, publicly and long-term available geochemical data services.

Please refer to the [governance document](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14222982) for full details on OneGeochemistry membership.



### Expert Committees

::: {.column width="82%"}
Multiple best practices and recommendations for specific data types, analytical techniques or sub-disciplines have already been defined (see [Best Practices](best_practices.qmd)). Such standardised protocols include method specific vocabularies as well as method-specific metadata profiles. The larger the size of the community that agrees and commits to a particular standard, the larger the community that can share and reuse data, particularly in machine-to-machine environments. OneGeochemistry provides the framework and support to harmonise and curate these existing standards through expert committees.

Expert Committees review, develop and update standards to enable FAIR and Open Geochemistry as the foundational elements of the OneGeochemistry data network. Standards will be registered with the IUGS Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI) and committees are encouraged to create citable publications in the peer-reviewed geochemical literature.

Get in touch at [onegeochemistry\@codata.org](mailto:onegeochemistry@codata.org) if you are interested or want to find out more.

[Join our Slack channel](https://onegeochemistry.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-18gjyj49u-FRf1XwCU1vj8xxCEUYoD7Q#/shared-invite/email) for ad-hoc updates and requests from the organisation, it is an open platform where you can share ideas and suggestions. This is the place for low latency messaging and rapid sharing of resources.

**OneGeochemistry Ambassadors** are envisaged as early to mid-career researchers that promote good data management following current best practices and standards. Assisted by the OneGeochemistry board members, ambassadors will spread awareness in the communities of the importance of data management in geo- and cosmochemistry, the existing landscape of data systems, and inspire new and future generations to contribute.
Contact [onegeochemistry\@codata.org](mailto:onegeochemistry@codata.org) to find out more.
