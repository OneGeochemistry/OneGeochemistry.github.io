    "section": "Town Hall: Resilience of Geochemical Databases",
    "text": "Town Hall: Resilience of Geochemical Databases\n9 July 2025: Goldschmidt Conference Prague.\nIn partnership with the OneGeochemistry initiative, representatives from major global geochemical databases issued a ‘Call to Action’ and held a Town Hall on Database Resilience at the Goldschmidt Conference in Prague, Czechia on 9 July 2025. Over 50 people attended and the goal was to offer a forum for the community to learn, discuss, and take action, towards more resilient data services for the future. The Town Hall aimed to:\n\nRaise awareness of the growing vulnerability of geochemical community databases.\nPromote the value of community databases for research in geochemistry and beyond.\nDeliberate on how to improve the sustainability and resilience of existing geochemical databases that depend on uncertain public funding.\n\nThe panelists included: Lesley Wyborn (AuScope/NCI/ARDC), Gerhard Wörner (DIGIS/GEOROC), Aleco Demetriades (IUGS Commission on Global Geochemical Baselines), Axel Renno (GeoReM, IAG), Mariano Remirez (Geochemical Society). Panelists considered four key scenarios that can threaten geochemical databases: natural disasters, cyberattacks, political interference and loss of funding/staff. Given that many of these threats happen on a national level, it is also essential that strategies are based on international collaboration and agreements regarding storage and access to back-up copies. All panel members emphasised the long term value of geo/cosmochemical databases. Many researchers rely on these publicly available databases to find data for use in research and teaching, or to store their own data when publishing in academic journals or other publication outlets. Unfortunately, many services depend on nationally awarded research grants that may or may not be available consistently and continuously in the future.\nDatabases in other disciplines that have achieved sustainability (e.g. Protein Database, Earthquake Databases) have in common highly standardised data structures/protocols. Geochemical data are extremely heterogeneous, and there are few accepted protocols and standards to enable interoperability of similar data types. In times of crisis, because of the small size of individual geochemical databases it is technically possible to copy threatened geochemical databases to safer sites. However, the true value in global geochemical databases is the harmonization of diverse and disparate datasets. It is not a question of archiving, therefore, but of integration and interoperability, which requires community agreed standards and protocols.\nConsensus was that going forward we need greater involvement of the geochemical societies and of the Early Career Researchers: and above all, sustainable funding. Long term sustainability of geochemical databases requires scientific community backing; a business model that minimizes dependence on research grants; culture change; incentives for researchers to deposit datasets in geochemistry-specific repositories, as well as training and support for early career researchers.\nThere was agreement that OneGeochemistry should follow up with geochemical societies and associations on raising awareness of the vulnerability of databases and to make this topic a regular discussion at future conferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the OneGeochemistry community mailing list to show your support and stay up to date.

    "text": "Editors Roundtable 2025\n8 July 2025: Goldschmidt Conference Prague.\nOneGeochemistry participated in the Editors’ Roundtable organized by the Astromat, DIGIS, and EarthChem cosmo-/geochemical data repositories at the Goldschmidt Conference 2025. The Editors’ Roundtable aims to foster a dialog between geochemical journals, publishers, and curated domain repositories with the goal to coordinate policies and procedures pertaining to the reporting of geo/cosmochemical data. It was first held in 2007/08 and a policy statement ‘Requirements for the Publication of Geochemical Data’ [1] was released in 2009. The Editors’ Roundtable re-started as an annual meeting at the Goldschmidt conference in 2023.\nThe 2025 Editors’ Roundtable included eleven journals with geo- and cosmochemical relevance: Advances in Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry; American Mineralogist; Critical Insights in Geochemistry and Geophysics; Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology; Environmental Geochemistry and Health; Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems; Geostandards & Geoanalytical Research; Icarus; Minerals; Precambrian Research; and Volcanica. Discussions centred around:\n\nDesire for better data quality vs. effort/resources required (for authors, editors and data systems alike; incl quantity and diversity of data within any one journal)\nSticks & carrots: journal/publisher/society requirements vs. community culture change\nQuestion of sustainability of any one data system or consortium: best to rely on alliance of societies? (take inspiration from Elements magazine)\nPromise and opportunities around future automation (file formats, data ingestion, machine readability)\nExamples of success in other disciplines, e.g. crystallography and seismology, that have established specific data management and editorial review processes\nSmall steps are better than nothing: encourage self-responsibility rather than trying to get it perfect from the start\n\nWith the goal to align data policies and ensure data quality review, repositories and editors revisited the 2009 policy statement [1]. Journal editors committed to enforcing these recommendations; while data systems will make available guidelines and tutorials to support authors.

AusGeochem: An Open Platform for Geochemical Data Preservation, Dissemination and Synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo promote a more efficient and transparent geochemistry data ecosystem, a consortium of Australian university research laboratories called the AuScope Geochemistry Network assembled to build a collaborative platform for the express purpose of preserving, disseminating and collating geochronology and isotopic data. In partnership with geoscience-data-solutions company Lithodat Pty Ltd, the open, cloud-based AusGeochem platform (https://ausgeochem.auscope.org.au) was developed to simultaneously serve as a geosample registry, a geochemical data repository and a data analysis tool. Informed by method-specific groups of geochemistry experts and established international data reporting practices, community-agreed database schemas were developed for rock and mineral geosample metadata and secondary ion mass spectrometry U-Pb analysis, with additional models for laser ablation-inductively coupled-mass spectrometry U-Pb and Lu-Hf, Ar-Ar, fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)/He under development. Collectively, the AusGeochem platform provides the geochemistry community with a new, dynamic resource to help facilitate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management, streamline data dissemination and advanced quantitative investigations of Earth system processes. By systematically archiving detailed geochemical (meta-)data in structured schemas, intractably large datasets comprising thousands of analyses produced by numerous laboratories can be readily interrogated in novel and powerful ways. These include rapid derivation of inter-data relationships, facilitating on-the-fly data compilation, analysis and visualisation.\nBoone, S.C., Dalton, H., Prent, A., Kohlmann, F., Theile, M., Gréau, Y., Florin, G., Noble, W., Hodgekiss, S., Ware, B., Phillips, D., Kohn, B., O’Reilly, S., Gleadow, A., McInnes, B., Rawling, T., 2022.

Geoanalytical Metrology.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chapter (Geoanalytical Metrology) is a contribution to the Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research Handbook of Rock and Mineral Analysis – an online textbook that is a fully revised and updated edition of Handbook of Silicate Rock Analysis, which was written by Philip J. Potts and published in 1987 by Blackie and Son (Glasgow). This second edition comprises chapters, written by prominent research scientists, designed to provide comprehensive overviews of the relevant techniques for the elemental characterisation of rocks and minerals. Chapters are designed to allow new practitioners to the field (including research students) to attain a comprehensive understanding of the theory, practice and capabilities of each technique, as well as being of benefit to established research geoanalysts. In addition to the content, chapter titles have been revised where appropriate to reflect progress in this field.  Chapter 1, Part 1 (from Section 1 of the handbook dealing with fundamentals of measurement and instrument design) first sets out the overarching conventions that operate in analytical chemistry, including a description of the international organisations and systems that regulate the standards governing the discipline. This is followed by coverage of the statistical basis on which geoanalytical data sets are treated, analysed and interpreted, which summarises most of the relevant tests and terminology employed in this field. The methods by which the calibration of measured signals from instrumental techniques is tackled, followed by method validation, which covers aspects including measurement uncertainty, bias, precision and trueness. Sections detailing metrological traceability and quality management conclude this chapter.\nLinge, K.L. and Potts, P.J.

Global Community Guidelines for Documenting, Sharing, and Reusing Quality Information of Individual Digital Datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen-source science builds on open and free resources that include data, metadata, software, and workflows. Informed decisions on whether and how to (re)use digital datasets are dependent on an understanding about the quality of the underpinning data and relevant information. However, quality information, being difficult to curate and often context specific, is currently not readily available for sharing within and across disciplines. To help address this challenge and promote the creation and (re)use of freely and openly shared information about the quality of individual datasets, members of several groups around the world have undertaken an effort to develop international community guidelines with practical recommendations for the Earth science community, collaborating with international domain experts. The guidelines were inspired by the guiding principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Use of the FAIR dataset quality information guidelines is intended to help stakeholders, such as scientific data centers, digital data repositories, and producers, publishers, stewards and managers of data, to: i) capture, describe, and represent quality information of their datasets in a manner that is consistent with the FAIR Guiding Principles; ii) allow for the maximum discovery, trust, sharing, and reuse of their datasets; and iii) enable international access to and integration of dataset quality information. This article describes the processes that developed the guidelines that are aligned with the FAIR principles, presents a generic quality assessment workflow, describes the guidelines for preparing and disseminating dataset quality information, and outlines a path forward to improve their disciplinary diversity.\nPeng, G., Lacagnina, C., Downs, R.R., Ganske, A., Ramapriyan, H.K., Ivánová, I., Wyborn, L., Jones, D., Bastin, L., Shie, C., Moroni, D.F., 2022.

Glossary of Analytical and Metrological Terms from the International Vocabulary of Metrology (2008).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM) has introduced a revised third edition of the International Vocabulary of Metrology – basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM: 2008) that replaces the second edition which was published in 1993. This article includes a table containing the terms and definitions that are most relevant to geoanalysis, designed to extend awareness and to promote best practice in the use of this terminology. Comparison is made, where appropriate, with definitions from the earlier 1993 definitions, to demonstrate the way in which thinking in metrological concepts has evolved over this time period.\nPotts, P.

Minimum requirements for publishing hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur stable-isotope delta results (IUPAC Technical Report).\n\n\n\n\n\nStable hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur (HCNOS) isotope compositions expressed as isotope-delta values are typically reported relative to international standards such as Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPDB) or Vienna Cañon Diablo Troilite (VCDT). These international standards are chosen by convention and the calibration methods used to realise them in practice undergo occasional changes. To ensure longevity and reusability of published data, a comprehensive description of (1) analytical procedure, (2) traceability, (3) data processing, and (4) uncertainty evaluation is required. Following earlier International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry documents on terminology and notations, this paper proposes minimum requirements for publishing HCNOS stable-isotope delta results. Each of the requirements are presented with illustrative examples.\nSkrzypek, Grzegorz, Allison, Colin E., Böhlke, John K., Bontempo, Luana, Brewer, Paul, Camin, Federica, Carter, James F., Chartrand, Michelle M.

Electronic data publication in geochemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany disciplines of geochemistry have no data reporting standards, and their use of metadata is inadequately developed. This presents problems to the quality of the published science, and it limits the utility of computers in data analysis and the exploitation of Information Technology (IT). We discuss problems of data and metadata publication, in particular for geochemistry, and offer solutions to these problems in the form of consistent data publication formats and a proposal for publication of metadata in geochemistry. Metadata are grouped according to types (location, sampling, characterization), and this grouping allows for the transfer of these formats to other Earth science disciplines. In a companion paper [Helly et al., 2003], we illustrate how these metadata groupings can be used in an IT context. Formats presented here are comprehensive and allow for modification and expansion. It is the hope of the authors that this paper initiates a constructive discussion of data formats and metadata in geochemistry.

A common standard template for representing stable isotope results and associated metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains a common standard template for representing the metadata of stable isotope results environmental samples (e.g., soils, rocks, water, gases) and a CSIRO-specific vocabulary for use across CSIRO research activities. The templates includes core properties of stable isotope results, analytical methods, and uncertainty of analyses, as well as associated metadata such as such as their name, identifier, type, and location. The templates enables users with disparate data to find common ground regardless of differences within the data itself i.e. sample types, collections.  The standardized templates can prevent duplicate sample metadata entry and lower metadata redundancy, thereby improving the stable isotope data curation and discovery. They have been developed iteratively, revised, and improved based on feedback from researchers and lab technicians.  Use of this template and vocabularies will facilitate interoperable and machine-readable platform-ready data collections.\nWelti, N., Flick, L., Hawkins, S., Fraser, G., Waltenberg, K., Crawford, J., Huhges, C., Puccini, A., Szarvas, S., Gerber, C., Suckow, A., Abhijit, P., & Liu, F.

Sample Identifiers and Metadata to Support Data Management and Reuse in Multidisciplinary Ecosystem Sciences.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical samples are foundational entities for research across biological, Earth, and environmental sciences. Data generated from sample-based analyses are not only the basis of individual studies, but can also be integrated with other data to answer new and broader-scale questions. Ecosystem studies increasingly rely on multidisciplinary team-science to study climate and environmental changes. While there are widely adopted conventions within certain domains to describe sample data, these have gaps when applied in a multidisciplinary context. In this study, we reviewed existing practices for identifying, characterizing, and linking related environmental samples. We then tested practicalities of assigning persistent identifiers to samples, with standardized metadata, in a pilot field test involving eight United States Department of Energy projects. Participants collected a variety of sample types, with analyses conducted across multiple facilities. We address terminology gaps for multidisciplinary research and make recommendations for assigning identifiers and metadata that supports sample tracking, integration, and reuse. Our goal is to provide a practical approach to sample management, geared towards ecosystem scientists who contribute and reuse sample data.\nDamerow, J.E., Varadharajan, C., Boye, K., Brodie, E.L., Burrus, M., Chadwick, K.D., Crystal-Ornelas, R., Elbashandy, H., Alves, R.J.E., Ely, K.S., Goldman, A.E., Haberman, T., Hendrix, V., Kakalia, Z., Kemner, K.M., Kersting, A.B., Merino, N., O’Brien, F., Perzan, Z., Robles, E., Sorensen, P., Stegen, J.C., Walls, R.L., Weisenhorn, P., Zavarin, M., Agarwal, D., 2021.

Community Established Best Practice Recommendations for Tephra Studies-from Collection through Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nTephra is a unique volcanic product with an unparalleled role in understanding past eruptions, long-term behavior of volcanoes, and the effects of volcanism on climate and the environment. Tephra deposits also provide spatially widespread, extremely high-resolution time-stratigraphic markers across a range of sedimentary settings and are used in a range of disciplines (e.g., volcanology, climate science, archaeology, ecology, and impact assessment). Nonetheless, the study of tephra deposits is challenged by a lack of standardization that often inhibits data integration across geographic regions and across disciplines.  Here we present comprehensive recommendations for tephra data gathering and reporting that were developed by the tephra science community to serve as guidelines for future investigators and to ensure that sufficient data are gathered for transparency and interoperability. Recommendations include standardized field and laboratory data collection along with reporting and correlation guidance. These are organized as tabulated lists of key metadata with their definition and purpose. They are system independent and usable for template, tool, and database development. This new standardized framework promotes consistent tephra documentation and archiving, fosters interdisciplinary communication, and improves effectiveness of data sharing among diverse communities of researchers.

The CMiO database is designed to capture multielement geochemical data from a wide variety of critical mineral-bearing deposits around the world. Samples included within this database must be well-characterized and come from localities that have been sufficiently studied to have a reasonable constraint on their deposit type and environment of formation. As such, only samples analysed by modern geochemical methods, and with certain minimum metadata attribution, can be accepted.

J. Potts, 1987, Blackie, Glasgow).  Chapter 7 (from Section 2 of the handbook dealing with techniques for the determination of major and trace elements) describes both the history of ICP-MS, including development of the plasma sampling interface and the operation of modern ICP-MS instrumentation. Given their central importance to ICP-MS operation, ion extraction through the sampling interface, ion transmission, ion separation (with a particular focus on the quadrupole mass filter) and counting are given particular attention. Discussion of the analytical characteristics of ICP-MS particularly focusses on spectroscopic interferences (and their mitigation). Finally, an overview of geochemical analysis by ICP-MS considers drift correction, calibration strategies, and laser ablation microsampling.\nLinge, K.L. (2024).

Overview of X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy standards, vocabularies (and ontologies), data formats and practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nX-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) research has expanded to become a set of widely used scientific methods with applications across Physics, Chemistry, Surface Science, Nanoscale Science, Biology, and Environmental and Earth Sciences. Over time, various scientific communities, research facilities, device providers, and software developers have created different formats and applications to store XAS data and describe it with metadata. These custom data formats serve their specific purposes, but they are not easily integrated or interoperable. Consequently, reusing XAS data from diverse sources—whether for further research, AI training, or the reproduction and replication of results—can be challenging. This is due to the diverse ways in which data is presented across domains and the limited availability of XAS data and metadata in public repositories. Using or combining these datasets often requires expert intervention and manual steps to map and process the data. Establishing commonly accepted standards for publishing XAS data is the first step in addressing these challenges.  This document provides a landscape analysis of current practices, standards, vocabularies, ontologies, schemas, and data formats used in the generation, curation, and publishing of X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) data, with a particular focus on efforts to create community standards that facilitate interoperability. We begin with an overview of current XAS techniques and their areas of application. Next, we discuss the development of custom formats for storing data and efforts to produce analysis techniques applicable regardless of data origin. We describe current efforts to generate standards that facilitate data interchange and integration, including various initiatives from research consortia aimed at creating interoperable formats, ontologies, and vocabularies. We conclude by observing the emerging consensus around using NXxas for multi-spectra raw and processed data and XDI for single spectra data.  This landscape analysis is part of the CDIF-4-XAS project, aimed at piloting an improved model for XAS data interoperability and reusability across scientific disciplines through the Cross Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF) developed by CODATA as part of the WorldFAIR project. The CDIF-4-XAS project seeks to enable seamless integration of XAS data into data catalogues and analysis frameworks in a universally interoperable manner, making it easier to reuse, compare, and incorporate into larger studies or used for training AI applications. Therefore, we conclude by introducing the next phase of work, which will be to use CDIF to develop interoperability profiles to enable the integration and mapping of NXxas and XDI data: the CDIF-4-XAS interoperability model.\nNieva de la Hidalga, A., Liborio, L., Austin, P., Kubin, M., Görzig, H., Krahl, R., Hodson, S., & Gregory, A.

Supplementary Information 1: A geospatial platform for the tectonic interpretation of low-temperature thermochronology Big Data.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo promote a more efficient and transparent geochemistry data ecosystem, a consortium of Australian university research laboratories called the AuScope Geochemistry Network assembled to build a collaborative platform for the express purpose of preserving, disseminating and collating geochronology and isotopic data. In partnership with geoscience-data-solutions company Lithodat Pty Ltd, the open, cloud-based AusGeochem platform (https://ausgeochem.auscope.org.au) was developed to simultaneously serve as a geosample registry, a geochemical data repository and a data analysis tool. Informed by method-specific groups of geochemistry experts and established international data reporting practices, community-agreed database schemas were developed for rock and mineral geosample metadata and secondary ion mass spectrometry U-Pb analysis, with additional models for laser ablation-inductively coupled-mass spectrometry U-Pb and Lu-Hf, Ar-Ar, fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)/He under development. Collectively, the AusGeochem platform provides the geochemistry community with a new, dynamic resource to help facilitate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management, streamline data dissemination and advanced quantitative investigations of Earth system processes. By systematically archiving detailed geochemical (meta-)data in structured schemas, intractably large datasets comprising thousands of analyses produced by numerous laboratories can be readily interrogated in novel and powerful ways. These include rapid derivation of inter-data relationships, facilitating on-the-fly data compilation, analysis and visualisation. Presented in Supplementary Information 1 are the fission track and (U-Th)/He datatables for AusGeochem, including data type and unit specifications, and field descriptions.\nBoone, S.C., Kohlmann, F., Noble, W. et al., 2023.

Recommendations for the reporting and interpretation of isotope dilution U-Pb geochronological information.\n\n\n\n\n\nU-Pb geochronology by isotope dilution−thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) has the potential to be the most precise and accurate of the deep time chronometers, especially when applied to high-U minerals such as zircon. Continued analytical improvements have made this technique capable of regularly achieving better than 0.1% precision and accuracy of dates from commonly occurring high-U minerals across a wide range of geological ages and settings. To help maximize the long-term utility of published results, we present and discuss some recommendations for reporting ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronological data and associated metadata in accordance with accepted principles of data management. Further, given that the accuracy of reported ages typically depends on the interpretation applied to a set of individual dates, we discuss strategies for data interpretation. We anticipate that this paper will serve as an instructive guide for geologists who are publishing ID-TIMS U-Pb data, for laboratories generating the data, the wider geoscience community who use such data, and also editors of journals who wish to be informed about community standards. Combined, our recommendations should increase the utility, veracity, versatility, and “half-life” of ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronological data.\nCondon, D., Schoene, B., Schmitz, M., Schaltegger, U., Ickert, R.

Guidelines for reporting and archiving 210Pb sediment chronologies to improve fidelity and extend data lifecycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiometric dating methods are essential for developing geochronologies to study Late Quaternary environmental change and 210Pb dating is commonly used to produce age-depth models from recent (within 150 years) sediments and other geoarchives. The past two centuries are marked by rapid environmental socio-ecological changes frequently attributed to anthropogenic land-use activities, modified biogeochemical cycles, and climate change. Consequently, historical reconstructions over this recent time interval have high societal value because analyses of these datasets provide understanding of the consequences of environmental modifications, critical ecosystem thresholds, and to define desirable ranges of variation for management, restoration, and conservation. For this information to be used more broadly, for example to support land management decisions or to contribute data to regional analyses of ecosystem change, authors must report all of the useful age-depth model information. However, at present there are no guidelines for researchers on what information should be reported to ensure 210Pb data are fully disclosed, reproducible, and reusable; leading to a plethora of reporting styles, including inadequate reporting that reduces potential reusability and shortening the data lifecycle. For example, 64% of the publications in a literature review of 210Pb dated geoarchives did not include any presentation of age uncertainty estimates in modeled calendar ages used in age-depth models. Insufficient reporting of methods and results used in 210Pb dating geoarchives severely hampers reproducibility and data reusability, especially in analyses that make use of databased palaeoenvironmental data. Reproducibility of data is fundamental to further analyses of the number of palaeoenvironmental data and the spatial coverage of published geoarchives sites. We suggest, and justify, a set of minimum reporting guidelines for metadata and data reporting for 210Pb dates, including an IEDA (Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance), LiPD (Linked Paleo Data) and generic format data presentation templates, to contribute to improvements in data archiving standards and to facilitate the data requirements of researchers analyzing datasets of several palaeoenvironmental study sites. We analyse practices of methods, results and first order interpretation of 210Pb data and make recommendations to authors on effective data reporting and archiving to maximize the value of datasets. We provide empirical evidence from publications and practitioners to support our suggested reporting guidelines. These guidelines increase the scientific value of 210Pb by expanding its relevance in the data lifecycle. Improving quality and fidelity of environmental datasets broadens interdisciplinary use, lengthens the potential lifecycle of data products, and achieves requirements applicable for evidenced-based policy support.\nCourtney Mustaphi, C.J., Brahney, J., Aquino-López, M.A., Goring, S., Orton, K., Noronha, A., Czaplewski, J., Asena, Q., Paton, S., Panga Brushworth, J., 2019.

Data reporting standards for publication of U-series data for geochronology and timescale assessment in the earth sciences.\n\n\n\n\n\nUranium-series data provide essential dating and tracer tools for a broad spectrum of geologic processes. Data reported in U-series geochronology studies often contain insufficient information to completely assess the data collected. It is frequently not possible to calculate a date using the information provided or to re-calculate using different parameters, ultimately limiting the value of the data. The decay constants used are particularly important in that some of the relevant U-series isotopes have been revised. Here we provide a rationale for a minimum set of required data that will enable most calculations and facilitate later data comparisons. Along with these data reporting norms, we discuss additional metadata that will improve understanding of the data and also enhance the ability to re-interpret and assess them in the context of other studies. We posit that these recommendations will provide a foundation for increasing the longevity and usefulness of measurements in the discipline of U-series geochronology.\nDutton, A., Rubin, K., McLean, N., Bowring, J., Bard, E., Edwards, R.L., Henderson, G.M., Reid, M.R., Richards, D.A., Sims, K.W.W., Walker, J.D., Yokoyama, Y., 2017.

Data, uncertainty, and reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe field of (U-Th)/He geochronology and thermochronology has grown enormously over the past ∼25 years. The tool is applicable across much of geologic time, new (U-Th)/He chronometers are under continuous development, and the method is used in a diverse array of studies. Consequently, the technique has a rapidly expanding user base, and new labs are being established worldwide. This presents both opportunities and challenges. Currently there are no universally agreedupon protocols for reporting measured (U-Th)/He data or data derivatives. Nor are there standardized practices for reporting He diffusion kinetic, 4He/3He, or continuous ramped heating data. Approaches for reporting uncertainties associated with all types of data also vary widely. Here, we address these issues. We review the fundamentals of the methods, the types of materials that can be dated, how data are acquired, the process and choices associated with data reduction, and make recommendations for data and uncertainty reporting. We advocate that both the primary measured and derived data be reported, along with statements of assumptions, appropriate references, and clear descriptions of the methods used to compute derived data from measured values. The adoption of more comprehensive and uniform approaches to data and uncertainty reporting will enable data to be re-reduced in the future with different interpretative contexts and data reduction methods, and will facilitate inter-comparison of data sets generated by different laboratories. Together, this will enhance the value, cross-disciplinary use, reliability, and ongoing development of (U-Th)/He chronology.\nFlowers, R.M., Zeitler, P.K., Danišík, M., Reiners, P.W., Gautheron, C., Ketcham, R.A., Metcalf, J.R., Stockli, D.F., Enkelmann, E., Brown, R.W., 2022.

Considerations for evaluating, integrating, and interpreting conventional individual aliquot data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe (U-Th)/He dating technique is an essential tool in Earth science research with diverse thermochronologic, geochronologic, and detrital applications. It is now used in a wide range of tectonic, structural, petrological, sedimentary, geomorphic, volcanological, and planetary studies. While in some circumstances the interpretation of (U-Th)/He data is relatively straightforward, in other cases it is less so. In some geologic contexts, individual analyses of the same mineral from a single sample are expected to yield dates that differ well beyond their analytical uncertainty owing to variable He diffusion kinetics. Although much potential exists to exploit this phenomenon to decipher more detailed thermal history information, distinguishing interpretable intra-sample data variation caused by kinetic differences between crystals from uninterpretable overdispersion caused by other factors can be challenging. Nor is it always simple to determine under what circumstances it is appropriate to integrate multiple individual analyses using a summary statistic such as a mean sample date or to decide on the best approach for incorporating data into the interpretive process of thermal history modeling. Here we offer some suggestions for evaluating data, attempt to summarize the current state of thinking on the statistical characterization of data sets, and describe the practical choices (e.g., model structure, path complexity, data input, weighting of different geologic and chronologic information) that must be made when setting up thermal history models. We emphasize that there are no hard and fast rules in any of these realms, which continue to be an important focus of improvement and community discussion, and no single interpretational and modeling philosophy should be forced on data sets. The guiding principle behind all suggestions made here is for transparency in reporting the steps and assumptions associated with evaluating, integrating, and interpreting data, which will promote the continued development of (U-Th)/He chronology.\nFlowers, R.

Community‐Derived Standards for LA‐ICP‐MS U‐(Th‐)Pb Geochronology – Uncertainty Propagation, Age Interpretation and Data Reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LA-ICP-MS U-(Th-)Pb geochronology international community has defined new standards for the determination of U-(Th-)Pb ages. A new workflow defines the appropriate propagation of uncertainties for these data, identifying random and systematic components. Only data with uncertainties relating to random error should be used in weighted mean calculations of population ages; uncertainty components for systematic errors are propagated after this stage, preventing their erroneous reduction. Following this improved uncertainty propagation protocol, data can be compared at different uncertainty levels to better resolve age differences. New reference values for commonly used zircon, monazite and titanite reference materials are defined (based on ID-TIMS) after removing corrections for common lead and the effects of excess 230Th. These values more accurately reflect the material sampled during the determination of calibration factors by LA-ICP-MS analysis. Recommendations are made to graphically represent data only with uncertainty ellipses at 2s and to submit or cite validation data with sample data when submitting data for publication. New data-reporting standards are defined to help improve the peer-review process. With these improvements, LA-ICP-MS U-(Th-)Pb data can be considered more robust, accurate, better documented and quantified, directly contributing to their improved scientific interpretation.\nHorstwood, M.S.A., Košler, J., Gehrels, G., Jackson, S.E., McLean, N.M., Paton, C., Pearson, N.J., Sircombe, K., Sylvester, P., Vermeesch, P., Bowring, J.F., Condon, D.J., Schoene, B., 2016.

Calculation and interpretation of ages and durations from U-Pb zircon geochronology of igneous rocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccurate assessment of the duration of zircon crystallization within igneous rocks is critical for constraining the time scales of magmatic evolution and storage, which have important implications for our understanding of magmatic fluxes and volcanic hazards. However, estimation of crystallization durations from finite geochronologic data sets is difficult and typically relies on numerous implicit assumptions. In this contribution, we evaluate these assumptions and provide recommendations for better interpretation of crystallization durations from individual samples by developing a simplified theoretical framework to relate zircon growth, nucleation, and armoring rates to zircon ages. We first investigate single zircon analyses and show that ages produced with methods that integrate the entire grain or grain fragments (e.g., chemical abrasion–isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry [CA-ID-TIMS]) are inevitably biased toward the second half of the zircon growth interval, while subsampling of grains via microbeam approaches will only capture the majority of the zircon crystallization duration when the microbeam spot size is less than ~25% of the zircon minor axis, and the analytical uncertainty of the measurement is less than ~20% of the duration over which the individual zircon grew.  We subsequently investigate the distribution of zircon mean ages produced through various combinations of zircon growth rate, nucleation rate, and the probability of zircon being armored by major phases. We show that zircon age distributions cannot be directly predicted from the rate of zircon mass crystallized, as many combinations of growth, nucleation, and armoring rates result in distinct age distributions, yet they produce nearly identical mass crystallization rates. Finally, we develop two equations that can be used to constrain the duration of crystallization observed within individual samples. In scenarios where the observed age dispersion is consistent with the reported analytical uncertainties, the first equation can be used to estimate the maximum duration. Otherwise, when the measured zircon population is overdispersed, a second equation constrains the minimum duration of zircon crystallization.\nKlein, B. Z., & Eddy, M. P., 2023. What’s in an age?

Interpreting and reporting fission-track chronological data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFission-track dating is based on the analysis of tracks—linear damage trails—produced by the spontaneous fission of 238U in a range of natural accessory minerals and glasses. The retention of tracks is sensitive to elevated temperatures, and the data serve principally as a tool for recording thermal histories of rocks, potentially over the range of ∼20−350 °C, depending on the specific minerals studied. As such, in most cases, fission-track data generally bear little or no direct relationship to the original formation age of the material studied. The age range of fission-track dating is related to the product of age and uranium content, and ages from several tens of years to older than 1 Ga are reported. Fission-track analysis led to the development of powerful modeling techniques. When used with appropriate geological constraints, these modeling techniques allow important geological processes to be addressed in a broad range of upper crustal settings.  Since early attempts to standardize the treatment of fission-track data and system calibration over more than 30 years ago, major advancements were made in the methodology, necessitating the development of new, updated data reporting requirements. Inconsistencies in reporting impede public data transparency, accessibility and reuse, Big Data regional syntheses, and interlaboratory analytical comparisons.  This paper briefly reviews the fundamentals of fission-track dating and applications to provide context for recommended guidelines for reporting and supporting essential meta fission-track data for publication and methodological archiving in structured formats that conform with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Adopting such practices will ensure that data can be readily accessed, interrogated, and reused, allowing for further integration with other numerical geoscience techniques.\nKohn, B. P., Ketcham, R.

Guide for interpreting and reporting luminescence dating results.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe development and application of luminescence dating and dosimetry techniques have grown exponentially in the last several decades. Luminescence methods provide age control for a broad range of geological and archaeological contexts and can characterize mineral and glass properties linked to geologic origin, Earth-surface processes, and past exposure to light, heat, and ionizing radiation. The applicable age range for luminescence methods spans the last 500,000 years or more, which covers the period of modern human evolution, and provides context for rates and magnitudes of geological processes, hazards, and climate change. Given the growth in applications and publications of luminescence data, there is a need for unified, community-driven guidance regarding the publication and interpretation of luminescence results.  This paper presents a guide to the essential information necessary for publishing and archiving luminescence ages as well as supporting data that is transportable and expandable for different research objectives and publication outlets. We outline the information needed for the interpretation of luminescence data sets, including data associated with equivalent dose, dose rate, age models, and stratigraphic context. A brief review of the fundamentals of luminescence techniques and applications, including guidance on sample collection and insight into laboratory processing and analysis steps, is presented to provide context for publishing and data archiving.\nMahan, S.

Interpreting and reporting 40Ar/39Ar geochronologic data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 40Ar/39Ar dating method is among the most versatile of geochronometers, having the potential to date a broad variety of K-bearing materials spanning from the time of Earth’s formation into the historical realm. Measurements using modern noble-gas mass spectrometers are now producing 40Ar/39Ar dates with analytical uncertainties of ∼0.1%, thereby providing precise time constraints for a wide range of geologic and extraterrestrial processes. Analyses of increasingly smaller subsamples have revealed age dispersion in many materials, including some minerals used as neutron fluence monitors. Accordingly, interpretive strategies are evolving to address observed dispersion in dates from a single sample. Moreover, inferring a geologically meaningful “age” from a measured “date” or set of dates is dependent on the geological problem being addressed and the salient assumptions associated with each set of data. We highlight requirements for collateral information that will better constrain the interpretation of 40Ar/39Ar data sets, including those associated with single-crystal fusion analyses, incremental heating experiments, and in situ analyses of microsampled domains. To ensure the utility and viability of published results, we emphasize previous recommendations for reporting 40Ar/39Ar data and the related essential metadata, with the amendment that data conform to evolving standards of being findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) by both humans and computers. Our examples provide guidance for the presentation and interpretation of 40Ar/39Ar dates to maximize their interdisciplinary usage, reproducibility, and longevity.\nSchaen, A.J., Jicha, B.R., Hodges, K.V., Vermeesch, P., Stelten, M.E., Mercer, C.M., Phillips, D., Rivera, T.A., Jourdan, F., Matchan, E.L., Hemming, S.R., Morgan, L.E., Kelley, S.P., Cassata, W.S., Heizler, M.T., Vasconcelos, P.M., Benowitz, J.A., Koppers, A.A.P., Mark, D.F., Niespolo, E.M., Sprain, C.J., Hames, W.E., Kuiper, K.F., Turrin, B.D., Renne, P.R., Ross, J., Nomade, S., Guillou, H., Webb, L.E., Cohen, B.A., Calvert, A.T., Joyce, N., Ganerød, M., Wijbrans, J., Ishizuka, O., He, H., Ramirez, A., Pfänder, J.A., Lopez-Martínez, M., Qiu, H., Singer, B.S., 2020.

Inorganic geochemistry of lake sediments: A review of analytical techniques and guidelines for data interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\nInorganic geochemistry is a powerful tool in paleolimnology. It has become one of the most commonly used techniques to analyze lake sediments, particularly due to the development and increasing availability of XRF core scanners during the last two decades. It allows for the reconstruction of the continuous processes that occur in lakes and their watersheds, and it is ideally suited to identify event deposits. How earth surface processes and limnological conditions are recorded in the inorganic geochemical composition of lake sediments is, however, relatively complex. Here, we review the main techniques used for the inorganic geochemical analysis of lake sediments and we offer guidance on sample preparation and instrument selection. We then summarize the best practices to process and interpret bulk inorganic geochemical data. In particular, we emphasize that log-ratio transformation is critical for the rigorous statistical analysis of geochemical datasets, whether they are obtained by XRF core scanning or more traditional techniques. In addition, we show that accurately interpreting inorganic geochemical data requires a sound understanding of the main components of the sediment (organic matter, biogenic silica, carbonates, lithogenic particles) and mineral assemblages. Finally, we provide a series of examples illustrating the potential and limits of inorganic geochemistry in paleolimnology. Although the examples presented in this paper focus on lake and fjord sediments, the principles presented here also apply to other sedimentary environments.\nBertrand, S., Tjallingii, R., Kylander, M.

The future low-temperature geochemical data-scape as envisioned by the U.S. geochemical community.\n\n\n\n\n\nData sharing benefits the researcher, the scientific community, and the public by allowing the impact of data to be generalized beyond one project and by making science more transparent. However, many scientific communities have not developed protocols or standards for publishing, citing, and versioning datasets. One community that lags in data management is that of low-temperature geochemistry (LTG). This paper resulted from an initiative from 2018 through 2020 to convene LTG and data scientists in the U.S. to strategize future management of LTG data. Through webinars, a workshop, a preprint, a townhall, and a community survey, the group of U.S. scientists discussed the landscape of data management for LTG – the data-scape. Currently this data-scape includes a “street bazaar” of data repositories. This was deemed appropriate in the same way that LTG scientists publish articles in many journals. The variety of data repositories and journals reflect that LTG scientists target many different scientific questions, produce data with extremely different structures and volumes, and utilize copious and complex metadata. Nonetheless, the group agreed that publication of LTG science must be accompanied by sharing of data in publicly accessible repositories, and, for sample-based data, registration of samples with globally unique persistent identifiers. LTG scientists should use certified data repositories that are either highly structured databases designed for specialized types of data, or unstructured generalized data systems. Recognizing the need for tools to enable search and cross-referencing across the proliferating data repositories, the group proposed that the overall data informatics paradigm in LTG should shift from “build data repository, data will come” to “publish data online, cybertools will find”. Funding agencies could also provide portals for LTG scientists to register funded projects and datasets, and forge approaches that cross national boundaries. The needed transformation of the LTG data culture requires emphasis in student education on science and management of data.\nBrantley, S.L., Wen, T., Agarwal, D.A., Catalano, J.G., Schroeder, P.A., Lehnert, K., Varadharajan, C., Pett-Ridge, J., Engle, M., Castronova, A.M., Hooper, R.P., Ma, X., Jin, L., McHenry, K., Aronson, E., Shaughnessy, A.R., Derry, L.A., Richardson, J., Bales, J., Pierce, E.M., 2021.

PaCTS 1.0: A Crowdsourced Reporting Standard for Paleoclimate Data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe progress of science is tied to the standardization of measurements, instruments, and data. This is especially true in the Big Data age, where analyzing large data volumes critically hinges on the data being standardized. Accordingly, the lack of community-sanctioned data standards in paleoclimatology has largely precluded the benefits of Big Data advances in the field. Building upon recent efforts to standardize the format and terminology of paleoclimate data, this article describes the Paleoclimate Community reporTing Standard (PaCTS), a crowdsourced reporting standard for such data. PaCTS captures which information should be included when reporting paleoclimate data, with the goal of maximizing the reuse value of paleoclimate data sets, particularly for synthesis work and comparison to climate model simulations. Initiated by the LinkedEarth project, the process to elicit a reporting standard involved an international workshop in 2016, various forms of digital community engagement over the next few years, and grassroots working groups. Participants in this process identified important properties across paleoclimate archives, in addition to the reporting of uncertainties and chronologies; they also identified archive-specific properties and distinguished reporting standards for new versus legacy data sets. This work shows that at least 135 respondents overwhelmingly support a drastic increase in the amount of metadata accompanying paleoclimate data sets. Since such goals are at odds with present practices, we discuss a transparent path toward implementing or revising these recommendations in the near future, using both bottom-up and top-down approaches.\nKhider, D., Emile‐Geay, J., McKay, N.P., Gil, Y., Garijo, D., Ratnakar, V., Alonso‐Garcia, M., Bertrand, S., Bothe, O., Brewer, P., Bunn, A., Chevalier, M., Comas‐Bru, L., Csank, A., Dassié, E., DeLong, K., Felis, T., Francus, P., Frappier, A., Gray, W., Goring, S., Jonkers, L., Kahle, M., Kaufman, D., Kehrwald, N.M., Martrat, B., McGregor, H., Richey, J., Schmittner, A., Scroxton, N., Sutherland, E., Thirumalai, K., Allen, K., Arnaud, F., Axford, Y., Barrows, T., Bazin, L., Pilaar Birch, S.E., Bradley, E., Bregy, J., Capron, E., Cartapanis, O., Chiang, H. ‐W., Cobb, K.M., Debret, M., Dommain, R., Du, J., Dyez, K., Emerick, S., Erb, M.P., Falster, G., Finsinger, W., Fortier, D., Gauthier, N., George, S., Grimm, E., Hertzberg, J., Hibbert, F., Hillman, A., Hobbs, W., Huber, M., Hughes, A.L.C., Jaccard, S., Ruan, J., Kienast, M., Konecky, B., Le Roux, G., Lyubchich, V., Novello, V.F., Olaka, L., Partin, J.W., Pearce, C., Phipps, S.J., Pignol, C., Piotrowska, N., Poli, M. ‐S., Prokopenko, A., Schwanck, F., Stepanek, C., Swann, G.E.A., Telford, R., Thomas, E., Thomas, Z., Truebe, S., Gunten, L., Waite, A., Weitzel, N., Wilhelm, B., Williams, J., Williams, J.J., Winstrup, M., Zhao, N., Zhou, Y., 2019.

Time to change the data culture in geochemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeochemical data are vital for understanding Earth’s past, present and future. However, currently only a fraction of geochemical data are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, limiting their use in the broadest range of scientific studies. There is an urgent need for international coordination of geochemical data and methods to unlock their full research potential.\nChamberlain, K. J., Lehnert, K. A., McIntosh, I. M., Morgan, D.

Ten simple rules for making a vocabulary FAIR.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe present ten simple rules that support converting a legacy vocabulary—a list of terms available in a print-based glossary or in a table not accessible using web standards—into a FAIR vocabulary. Various pathways may be followed to publish the FAIR vocabulary, but we emphasise particularly the goal of providing a globally unique resolvable identifier for each term or concept. A standard representation of the concept should be returned when the individual web identifier is resolved, using SKOS or OWL serialised in an RDF-based representation for machine-interchange and in a web-page for human consumption. Guidelines for vocabulary and term metadata are provided, as well as development and maintenance considerations. The rules are arranged as a stepwise recipe for creating a FAIR vocabulary based on the legacy vocabulary. By following these rules you can achieve the outcome of converting a legacy vocabulary into a standalone FAIR vocabulary, which can be used for unambiguous data annotation. In turn, this increases data interoperability and enables data integration.\nCox SJD, Gonzalez-Beltran AN, Magagna B, Marinescu M-C 2021. Ten simple rules for making a vocabulary FAIR.

A Guide to Using GitHub for Developing and Versioning Data Standards and Reporting Formats.\n\n\n\n\n\nData standardization combined with descriptive metadata facilitate data reuse, which is the ultimate goal of the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles. Community data or metadata standards are increasingly created through an approach that emphasizes collaboration between various stakeholders. Such an approach requires platforms for collaboration on the development process that centers on sharing information and receiving feedback. Our objective in this study was to conduct a systematic review to identify data standards and reporting formats that use version control for developing data standards and to summarize common practices, particularly in earth and environmental sciences. Out of 108 data standards and reporting formats identified in our review, 32 used GitHub as the version control platform, and no other platforms were used. We found no universally accepted methodology for developing and publishing data standards. Many GitHub repositories did not use key features that could help developers to gather user feedback, or to create and revise standards that build on previous work. We provide guidance for community-driven standard development and associated documentation on GitHub based on a systematic review of existing practices.\nCrystal-Ornelas, R., Varadharajan, C., Bond-Lamberty, B., Boye, K., Burrus, M., Cholia, S., et al., 2021.

The MetBase database has been merged into Astromat.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetBase has been the world’s largest database for meteorite compositions, but has now passed this torch on to the Astromaterials Data System (Astromat), into which MetBase has recently been merged. This merger had been planned for some time and took almost 1 year to complete. Not only differences in the structure of the databases, in the content and organization of data and metadata, and in the terminology used but also incorporation of new data needed to be resolved to combine the data holdings of MetBase with the Astromat synthesis database. Astromat is NASA’s primary archive for laboratory analyses of astromaterial samples and funded by NASA to provide services for the preservation and open access of data from astromaterials, including meteorites, in alignment with the FAIR principles. After merging MetBase into Astromat’s synthesis database, this now provides the cosmochemical community the largest compilation of cosmochemical analytical data by far: over 2 million analytical data points. Astromat is also part of a bigger ecosystem of geo- and cosmochemcial databases, as its foundation is aligned with other large geochemical databases such as EarthChem and GEOROC. The visualization tools and the teaching tool from MetBase will be further developed and now exist as independent tools. We provide a brief history of the two databases and their journeys, an outlook toward the future, as well as lessons learned from this merger. We recommend that other cosmochemical databases try whenever possible to adopt the Astromat database schema as early as possible, or get in contact for alternative options. We believe MetBase now being a part of Astromat is a match made in heaven and hope Astromat will become a reliable and trusted service within the community.\nHezel, D.C., Lehnert, K.A., Elangovan, P., Ji, P., Mays, J., Koblitz, J.

Geochemical Databases.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeochemistry is a data-driven discipline. Modern laboratories produce highly diverse data, and the recent exponential increase in data volumes is challenging established practices and capabilities for organizing, analyzing, preserving, and accessing these data. At the same time, sophisticated computational techniques, including machine learning, are increasingly applied to geochemical research questions, which require easy access to large volumes of high-quality, well-organized, and standardized data. Data management has been important since the beginning of geochemistry but has recently become a necessity for the discipline to thrive in the age of digitalization and artificial intelligence. This paper summarizes the landscape of geochemical databases, distinguishing different types of data systems based on their purpose, and their evolution in a historic context. We apply the life cycle model of geochemical data; explain the relevance of current standards, practices, and policies that determine the design of modern geochemical databases and data management; the ethics of data reuse such as data ownership, data attribution, and data citation; and finally create a vision for the future of geochemical databases: data being born digital, connected to agreed community standards, and contributing to global democratization of geochemical data.\nKlöcking, M., Lehnert, K., & Wyborn, L.

Towards a Digital IUPAC.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunicating chemical knowledge is at the core of the IUPAC mission and underlies the success of the chemistry enterprise. In the global economy of the 21st century, this involves exchange among computer systems along with the expert scientists who use them. To enable the application of IUPAC outputs in the digital environment, IUPAC must augment its efforts to enable accessibility and interpretation by machines as well as humans. The Union must adapt to a digital work culture to engage in its mission of sustainable development, common language and free exchange of scientific information. [Frey 2014, https://doi.org/10.1515/ci.2014.36.1.14]\nThe Committee on Publications and Cheminformatics Data Standards (CPCDS)(https://iupac.org/body/024) is charged to develop standards that enable and “promote interoperable and consistent transmission, storage, and management of digital [chemical information] content.” Since 2016, the CPCDS Subcommittee on Cheminformatics Data Standards has been tasked to explore the needs of the chemical community with the objective of coordinating the collective expertise of relevant IUPAC Divisions and Committees and external global organizations. A special issue of Chemistry International on “Research Data, Big Data and Chemistry” was edited by the Subcommittee for the 49th General Assembly in São Paulo (https://iupac.org/etoc-alert-chemistry-international-jul-sep-2017/)\nAs demonstrated in related communities of practice such as crystallography, machine readable scientific definitions and standard data formats facilitate accurate reporting, further scientific analysis and processing of measurements. Collective sharing of data within a domain enables the generation of new insights that are applicable more broadly. The adoption of standard file formats and standard identifiers across the community and stakeholders greatly aids in workflows to accurately publish and share data in digital venues. [Bruno 2020, https://charlestonlibraryconference.com/here-come-the-data/]\nDeveloping and disseminating digital representations of IUPAC intellectual assets is not simply a software problem. Criteria for machine readability needs to be robust, function consistently across many different computer systems, and be based on accepted Internet protocols. The FAIR Data Principles describe high level criteria for enabling data and associated information to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable for both humans and machines in a distributed digital environment. These principles provide a good starting point for understanding what is required to enable data to be effectively shared and allows IUPAC to tap into many motifs for digital exchange emerging in the data sciences and informatics expert communities.

Putting the Trust into Trusted Data Repositories: A Federated Solution for the Australian National Imaging Facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Imaging Facility (NIF) provides Australian researchers with state-of-the-art instrumentation—including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), X-ray computed tomography (CT) and multispectral imaging – and expertise for the characterisation of animals, plants and materials.\nTo maximise research outcomes, as well as to facilitate collaboration and sharing, it is essential not only that the data acquired using these instruments be managed, curated and archived in a trusted data repository service, but also that the data itself be of verifiable quality. In 2017, several NIF nodes collaborated on a national project to define the requirements and best practices necessary to achieve this, and to establish exemplar services for both preclinical MRI data and clinical ataxia MRI data.\nIn this paper we describe the project, its key outcomes, challenges and lessons learned, and future developments, including extension to other characterisation facilities and instruments/modalities.\nMehnert, A.

The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.\nWilkinson, M. D., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, Ij. J., Appleton, G., … Mons, B., 2016. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship.

A modular approach to developing interdisciplinary, interoperable standards for geochemical data based on the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) Ontology.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteroperability across multiple scientific disciplines has generally had limited success, as most standards are specific to a single community or discipline. However, many components of scientific data are common to multiple disciplines, and if these can be identified and leveraged then valuable foundations are laid for cross-discipline interoperability. A recent joint W3C and OGC standard - the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology - specifies the semantics of sensors, observation, sampling, and actuation, and supports a modular approach to the specification of the details of these elements of a scientific information system. This separation of concerns then allows the relevant experts to define community-endorsed standards for individual disciplines, with protocols and vocabularies in each of the modular components, within a common overall framework. Where the same component is used in many disciplines (e.g., geographical location, units of measure, colour, elements of the periodic table, definition of magnetic properties) common (universal) reference standards, protocols, can be established. This modular approach will ultimately facilitate interdisciplinary science and lay the foundations for digital scientific data to be born connected to multiple disciplines. An example of this approach is shown through the subdiscipline of geochemistry.\nWyborn, L.A.I., Cox, S.J.D., Lehnert, K.A., and Klump, K., 2018.

Enabling FAIR data in Geochemistry through the WorldFAIR Project.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasingly policy makers, funders, and publishers require geochemical datasets to be compliant with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) Principles [1]. However, inconsistent interpretations of FAIR in geochemistry mean many researchers do not know what FAIR compliance entails and seek guidance. The OneGeochemistry initiative aims to establish global best practices for FAIR geochemical laboratory data.  OneGeochemistry participated in the CODATA and RDA-led WorldFAIR Project on Global Cooperation on FAIR Data Policy and Practice, that was funded by the European Commission for 2022-2024 and collectively sought to advance implementation of the FAIR principles and improve Interoperability and Reusability by connecting initiatives on data management and FAIR data practices, including using FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIPs).  The Project concluded that a dual approach to accelerating standards/best practices to enable FAIR compliance is recommended to increase FAIRness of geochemical data:\n\n\nAs geochemistry consists of multiple sub-disciplines, each with its own methods and terminologies, multiple working groups will be needed to develop required best practices for each; and\n\n\nAs there are already many community protocols and best practices at either the local, national, or international level, there is an urgency to publish online current existing protocols, vocabularies, etc., with a view to forming focused international communities of practice to coalesce on global data agreements.\n\n\nFour Deliverables were produced by the Geochemistry Case Study in the WorldFAIR Project: these are summarised and links are provided to each.\nWyborn, L., Prent, A., Klöcking, M., Lehnert, K., Farrington, R., Nixon, A., Hezel, D., Elger, K., & Profeta, L.

WorldFAIR Deliverable D5.3: Guidelines for implementing Geochemistry FIPs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a long-tail scientific discipline with highly specific and heterogeneous analytical methods, the geochemistry community faces challenges in achieving FAIR data compliance. While many repositories satisfy the Findable and Accessible principles of FAIR, increased modernisation of existing standards and development of additional data standards are required to achieve Interoperability and Reusability of data.  This third deliverable of the WorldFAIR Geochemistry Work Package (WP05) aims to guide the geochemistry data infrastructure community towards convergence by identifying FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs) that are currently being used by the geosciences community. Promulgation of used resources and their uptake by other infrastructure providers is part of the push towards convergence. The WorldFAIR Geochemistry Work Package proposes creating a reference FIP or catalogue of FERs to promote interoperability and prevent duplication of efforts. The geochemistry reference FIP is designed as a living document, allowing continual updates by the community. It serves as a tool for laboratories, repositories, and infrastructure providers to enhance data FAIRness. Through the provision of a reference FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) or catalogue of FERs as part of this report, data providers and producers are provided with a tool to help select FERs when building or updating their infrastructure to become more FAIR.  Together with the second deliverable (D5.2) of the WorldFAIR Geochemistry Work Package which outlined the usefulness and importance of FIPs, this report and the associated reference FIP can be used by the geochemistry community - particularly by data creators and providers - to improve their FAIRness. We recommend that new and emerging geochemistry data producers and providers consult the geochemistry reference FIP and ideally choose to implement existing FERs, although the selection and implementation of FERs should align with the principles and community needs that the specific data system serves.  The goal is to facilitate the implementation of commonly-used FERs, and so improving data FAIRness, with a resource that fosters interoperability, accelerates convergence on data standards, and ultimately enhances the accessibility and reusability of geochemical data. This report and the reference FIP aim to encourage the reuse of available resources, prevent duplication, and enhance convergence on data standards within the geochemistry community. Community collaboration, the continuous evolution of the living reference FIP document to support FAIR compliance and convergence towards standardisation are needed to continue improving FAIRness in the geochemistry data community.\nPrent, A., Farrington, R., Wyborn, L., Nixon, A., Elger, K., Klöcking, M., Hezel, D., & Lehnert, K. (2024). WorldFAIR (D5.3) Guidelines for implementing Geochemistry FIPs (Version 1). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10712808\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrent+ 2024. WorldFAIR Deliverable D5.2: Geochemistry Methodology and Outreach.\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether with the earlier WorldFAIR Milestone 6, this D5.2 report focuses on advocating the utility and significance of FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIPs) for the geochemistry community, culminating in presenting a set of policy and organisational recommendations. The primary goal of this report is to foster alignment across the complex and heterogeneous geochemistry community, in producing and integrating FAIR data for the huge diversity of sample types and target analytes of this community, each often having numerous analytical methods. This document presents various ways in which the community can increase FAIRness through the publication of FERs for different levels of data granularity and FAIR community size and complexity (Figure 2). Additionally, interoperability of data between methodologies is suggested to be overcome through data abstraction (Box 1).  Following the FIP methodology, this D5.2 report makes reference to the fifteen FAIR Principles, divided into scientific and technical components. Scientific component implementations, and related community engagement, are to be based on best practice publications that outline data reporting and methodology descriptions from within specific geochemistry sub-disciplines. Parts of these publications, including tables and images in PDF or document formats, could be converted into machine actionable FAIR-enabling resources (FERs), and be part of a generic FIP for geochemistry. Technical components need to be generated, reviewed and assessed by geochemistry data infrastructure and repository technical staff, along with the development of additionally needed FERs in consultation with other FAIR data management expert groups (e.g., CODATA-DDI Alliance activity, the DDI-CDI group, the RDA Vocabulary Services Interest Group, IUPAC, etc.) and the “Ten Simple Rules for making a vocabulary FAIR” (Cox et al. 2021).  This report is the result of interactions with the geochemistry community through the OneGeochemistry Initiative, its board members, research infrastructure experts, analytical facilities and international leaders in geochemistry data management systems (EarthChem, DIGIS-GEOROC, AGN–AusGeochem, GFZ Data Services, NFDI4Earth, and EPOS MSL Laboratories).\nPrent, A., Wyborn, L., & Farrington, R.

WorldFAIR Milestone MS6: Geochemistry Scientific Content Component.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldFAIR Milestone 6, reported here, specifies work done and being undertaken for Deliverable 5.2 (due month 20), ‘Geochemistry Methodology and Outreach’, which has the following description: “This deliverable will outline the methodology used to develop and update FIPs and promulgate knowledge of them, including publishers to ensure the quality, interoperability and reusability of data in publications”.  As geochemical data is collected on a diversity of natural and synthetic samples (rocks, sediments, minerals, fossils, meteorites, cosmic dust, fluids, gases, etc), from the Earth or other planetary bodies, there is an incredible range of analytical instruments used and hundreds of analytical techniques applied. This results in a community with many subdisciplines that produce typically ‘long tail’ data - data that are highly specific and small in volume. The community and the data produced are heterogeneous and overlaps of common minimum variables are scarce.  We conclude that developing a single FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) for all geochemical data will not be possible; rather, there will need to be multiple linked FIPs for geochemistry subdisciplines and at multiple levels of granularity. As a FIP is underpinned by FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs), many such FERs need to be publicly available or need to be published. By specifying any FER(s) that accompany each FAIR principle within the individual FIP, users of any geochemical dataset/database will have accurate documentation for each FAIR Principles, and thus enhance machine readability.  This Milestone describes progress towards developing a methodology designed to assist in defining the individual FERs required to fully describe the minimum scientific and technical variables used to describe any geochemical analysis. These FERs will enable the generation of multiple FIPs, facilitating published results to be reproduced and shared globally with sufficient metadata to make any geochemical resource FAIR for both humans and machines.  This Milestone report then discusses how the components of this methodology are being executed in the community, discusses resulting progress towards minimum common variables of samples, discusses how to make best practices for geochemical methods available online and specifies a set of vocabularies published to describe methodologies.\nPrent, A., Wyborn, L., Farrington, R., Lehnert, K., Klöcking, M., Elger, K., Hezel, D., ter Maat, G., Profeta, L., & Rawling, T.

Community recommendations for geochemical data, services and analytical capabilities in the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of geochemical and cosmochemical research is based upon observations and, in particular, upon the acquisition, processing and interpretation of analytical data from physical samples. The exponential increase in volumes and rates of data acquisition over the last century, combined with advances in instruments, analytical methods and an increasing variety of data types analysed, has necessitated the development of new ways of data curation, access and sharing. Together with novel data processing methods, these changes have enabled new scientific insights and are driving innovation in Earth and Planetary Science research. Yet, as approaches to data-intensive research develop and evolve, new challenges emerge. As large and often global data compilations increasingly form the basis for new research studies, institutional and methodological differences in data reporting are proving to be significant hurdles in synthesising data from multiple sources. Consistent data formats and data acquisition descriptions are becoming crucial to enable quality assessment, reusability and integration of results fostering confidence in available data for reuse. Here, we explore the key challenges faced by the geo- and cosmochemistry community and, by drawing comparisons from other communities, recommend possible approaches to overcome them. The first challenge is bringing together the numerous sub-disciplines within our community under a common international initiative. One key factor for this convergence is gaining endorsement from the international geochemical, cosmochemical and analytical societies and associations, journals and institutions. Increased education and outreach, spearheaded by ambassadors recruited from leading scientists across disciplines, will further contribute to raising awareness, and to uniting and mobilising the community. Appropriate incentives, recognition and credit for good data management as well as an improved, user-oriented technical infrastructure will be essential for achieving a cultural change towards an environment in which the effective use and real-time interchange of large datasets is common-place. Finally, the development of best practices for standardised data reporting and exchange, driven by expert committees, will be a crucial step towards making geo- and cosmochemical data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by both humans and machines (FAIR).\nKlöcking M, Wyborn L, Lehnert KA, Ware B, Prent AM, Profeta L, Kohlmann F, Noble W, Bruno I, Lambart S, Ananuer H, Barber ND, Becker H, Brodbeck M, Deng H, Deng K, Elger K, Franco GdS, Gao Y, Ghasera KM, Hezel DC, Huang J, Kerswell B, Koch H, Lanati AW, Maat Gt, Martínez-Villegas N, Yobo LN, Redaa A, Schäfer W, Swing MR, Taylor RJM, Traun MK, Whelan J, Zhou T., 2023.

WorldFAIR Deliverable D5.1: Formalisation of OneGeochemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\nReport on the formalisation of the OneGeochemistry CODATA Working Group. Project Deliverable D5.1 for EC WIDERA-funded project “WorldFAIR: Global cooperation on FAIR data policy and practice”.  The WorldFAIR Geochemistry Work Package Deliverable 5.1 sets out to formalise the OneGeochemistry Initiative. With the exponential growth of data volumes and production, better coordination and collaboration is needed within the Earth and Planetary Science community producing geochemical data. The mission of OneGeochemistry is to address this need and in order to do so effectively the OneGeochemistry Interim Board has applied to become the OneGeochemistry CODATA Working Group. This application has been approved by the CODATA Executive Committee. The OneGeochemistry CODATA Working Group will be led by a chair and co-chair and will form expert advisory groups where required. Becoming a CODATA Working Group gives the OneGeochemistry Initiative credibility and authority to successfully pursue a long-term governance structure and accomplish the other WorldFAIR deliverables of WP05 (Geochemistry).  Accomplishing an outline of the methodology used to populate and update FAIR Implementation Profiles and to promulgate knowledge of them, as well as creating a set of guidelines for laboratories and repositories on how to use FAIR Implementation Profiles and common variables to QA/QC data, will enable FAIRer (Wilkinson et al., 2016) geochemical data, which will in turn make interdisciplinary use easier.  Geochemical data has direct application to six of the seventeen UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG#6 (Clean Water and Sanitation); SDG#7 (Affordable and Clean Energy); SDG#8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth); SDG#9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure); SDG#13 (Climate Action); SDG#15 (Life on Land) and FAIR geochemical data will accelerate the generation of new geoscientific knowledge and discoveries. Within the greater framework of the WorldFAIR project, this deliverable has come together in collaboration with CODATA (WP01 and WP02) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC, WP03).\nPrent, A., & Rawling, T.
